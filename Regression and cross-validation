A typical cross validation steps 
1 Train-test split
2 With train data, Built several model with different hyper parameters
(or build different models with different features, or use different ml algorithms)

3 Split Train data into train and validation data (train-validation split)

4 For each model, get an average score from k-fold cross-validation
(use cross-validation to compare/evaluate different models)
train and validate k times, get k instances for each model, get an average of score

5 Select the best model hyper-parameter (or features)
6 use the hyper-parameter (or the features) to build a final model, with both train and validation data together
7 Use the final model on test data to get test error

Logistic regression: 
AUC: represents accuracy
